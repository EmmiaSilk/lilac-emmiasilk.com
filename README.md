This repository makes up the app I will use for my website after I can afford to actually pay for a web server.
=======
This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

* Configuration

* Database creation

* Database initialization

* How to run the test suite

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

* Deployment instructions

* ...

## Prerequisites
* Ruby - 2.4.4+
* Rails - 5.2.0
* Node.js - 6.0.0?
* Yarn - ???

## Getting the server running
After cloning the repository, you should theoretically be able to run the following commands to get the server in a functional state. I make no promises to whether this will actually work.
```shell
git clone https://github.com/EmmiaSilk/lilac-emmiasilk.com.git
cd lilac-emmiasilk.com
bundle install
yarn install
rails db:migrate
```


To run the server
<<<<<<< HEAD
```shell

```
>>>>>>> eee42ac479921a28d625d8faf9eb2ad365ca502e
rails server
```

When editing stylesheets, you will want to have the webpacker development server running. This will let your scss code automatically get sent to your browser.
